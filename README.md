## Welcome to Supertype Fellowship

The Onboarding ðŸ›« Collection is intended to help you get started with the Supertype Fellowship. It will help you understand the purpose of the Fellowship, how to get started, and how to get the most out of your experience with us. 

You should start by:
1.  Reading the [Fellowship Overview](https://supertype.ai/fellowship/overview) ([_not implemented yet_]) to understand the purpose of the Fellowship and how it works.
2.  Register for an account on [Supertype Fellowship](https://fellowship.supertype.ai)
    - Your Fellowship username will be used to verify your identity in the next step, so choose one that is short and memorable
3.  Register for a GitHub account, and create a new repository with the name `supertype-fellowship`.
    - The repository should be public, and should be created under your own GitHub account
    - This repository should therefore be accessible at the URL (`github.com/<your-github-handle>/supertype-fellowship`)
4.  Create a new file in this repository (from step 3) and name it `verify-<your-fellowship-username>.txt`

    - For example, if your Fellowship username is `pambeesly`, then the file should be named `verify-pambeesly.txt`
    - This file should be committed to the `main` branch of the repository created in step 3

5.  Sign it to Fellowship with the account you created, bookmark the **Onboarding ðŸ›« Collection**, click on **Verify Identity** to reveal your 16-digit identity verification code, and paste it into the file you created in step 4.
    - Your verification file should contain only the 16-digit code, and nothing else
6.  Commit the file to the `main` branch of the repository created in step 3 and push it to GitHub. Once committed, use the 'Mark Challenge as Completed' button on **Onboarding ðŸ›« Collection** to reveal field for the Proof of Completion.
    - Enter your GitHub handle in the Proof of Completion field, and click 'Submit'. Verification should be immediate. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰!
